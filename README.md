# 📝 Auth Session Cookie

This is a Java-based task manager application with role-based authorization, Cookie and Sessions-based session handling.

The application follows a clean layered architecture with a clear separation of concerns: controllers handle HTTP requests, services encapsulate business logic, and repositories manage access to data.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Security (Session + Cookie-based auth)
- Spring Data JPA + Hibernate
- Thymeleaf + HTML
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose

## 📦 Features

- 👥 Registration & login (Cookie + Session)
- 🪪 Account creation, update, deletion
- 📌 Display information about employees and tasks
- 📝 Task management (admin)
- 👤 Role-based access (User/Admin)
- 🧩 Input validation with custom annotations

docker-compose up --build
```
